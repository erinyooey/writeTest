       Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be equal to [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]

 Functional Tests:

    1. - When a user tries to "Check Out" with an empty cart, an error should be shown and they should be prompted to continue shopping 
       - When a user is not logged in and clicks "Check Out" with items in their cart, an option should be displayed to either "Log In" or "Create Account"

       - When a user clicks "Log In" during checkout process but enters incorrect credentials, they should be shown an error.
       - When a user clicks "Log In" but has filled in their login and password correctly, they should be taken to the checkout page.
       - When a user clicks "Create Account" during the checkout process and fills out the form correctly, they should be redirected to the confirmation page and the items in their cart should be preserved.
       - When a user clicks "Create Account" during the checkout process but fills out the form incorrectly, an error should be shown and the user should be prompted to fill out the form again.
